                            Once, upon a time, there was a girl: Kari. As a child, she dreamed to help other people.
                            She was attending the healing school of the kingdom to learn how to.
                            After 6 long springs, she finally finished it. It was a school where people were taught to do magic,
                            use potions and work with unbelievable machinery. It was the time to look for a position at the local crafts fairs.
                            Not much luck in the beginning. It was a poor kingdom. And if you didn't know someone in the royal healing department,
                            it's tough to get something. \nEven worse, one day, Livia got challenged by a villain! His name was Self-Criticism.
                            It was him that made Livia forget about her beauty, skills and knowledge. It was him that made her forget about her
                            long life dream of helping other people. The villain would constantly undermine her. He would use tips and tricks
                            like making her: mistrustful and doubt herself. But, Kari managed to fight back. Several times.
                            She knows that Self Criticism can be defeated. And she silently is preparing a plan to fight back!
                            And maybe, one day, she will fulfil her long life dream to help people.
